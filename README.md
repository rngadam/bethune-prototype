## Bethune

> There is no question that the Dominion Bank under the direction of [Bethune](http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio.php?id_nbr=5975) was astonishingly successful. In the 24 years that he was its general manager, Canada experienced three severe economic downturns, one in each decade. During that period the bank always reported a profit, always added to its reserves, always paid a dividend which equalled or bettered those of its competitors, and generally kept out of trouble. The value of its shares just kept climbing. By July 1894 the original shareholders had experienced an eight per cent compound annual growth in the value of their shares as compared with four and a half per cent, the rate at the next most successful bank, the Commerce. All this success was accomplished within Ontario, for the Dominion had no office outside the province until after Bethuneâ€™s death, although other Canadian banks acted as its representative elsewhere. By staying in Ontario the Dominion was able to avoid the effects of the disastrous collapse of the Winnipeg real-estate market in the mid 1880s.
